Run by `scripts/launch/run_browser_lane_against_staging.sh`. See
`signup_to_paid_invoice.txt` and/or
`billing_portal_payment_method_update.txt` for per-spec stdout.
Playwright artifacts under
`web/test-results/` and `web/playwright-report/` are NOT copied here
by default — the operator should run `cp -r web/test-results <bundle>`
after the run if needed for failure diagnosis.
